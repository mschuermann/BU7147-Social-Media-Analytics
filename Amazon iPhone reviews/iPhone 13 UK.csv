Great phone but please. Get a screen protector,"Okay I’ve had the phone for a few months now but there is this one scratch on the screen that has come from nowhere and even with apples “scratch resistant screen” it makes no difference. My iPhone 6 (phone before this 13) had scratches on the back but nothing on the screen. It’s really sad and you can’t see it but you know it’s there , then you look for it. Fine it. Then you are sad again",3.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 December 2021,3
Excellent Phone Fantastic Colour,ive owned many iPhones in the past and this has to be one of the best ones ive owned.the battery life is amazing.the photo quality is great.plus 5G is a bonus for me and its faster than my broadband at home.I don't miss the power brick as I wireless charge my phone anyway.but I have to say so far I can't fault it in anyway and id highly recommend it if you can afford it to go for the 256gb model.and deffo take out apple care as it offers accidental damage on the device as well as normal coverage.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 March 2022,3

"My first footsteps with an iPhone,","Image and state of the art gadgets, phones etc have not been a priority in using technology, If it ain’t broken don’t fix it. Well my old phone was broken the screen was turning into a mosaic with shards of glass desperately trying to sneak through the screen cover. It was tired and worn out, so, tine for a new model. I have a sim only contract as I prefer to own my phone & upgrade it if & when I like. Time to venture into the land of Apple iPhones, I have had an iPad for a few years, love the speed of it compared to Android. The iPhone 13 has the same speed & qualities and I am really impressed with it. It is the only phone we use, no landline. The apps are quick to open, the camera is much better quality and the aesthetics are clean and streamlined. It has a bigger screen size than my old phone all the better for us oldies and having arthritis in my hands it is easier to grip the larger size. Transferring files, settings, apps etc was a doddle. Storage capacity much bigger than I am used to. All in all I am delighted with my new phone and hope to be using it for a long while to cone,",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 March 2022,8
Is an iPhone,Purchased as an upgrade for my wife who swears by apple. I have a much cheaper alternative but when compared against each other the iPhone comes out on top in every department. They are expensive - I personally wouldn't spend that much on a phone for myself but for my wife its worth double to stop the nagging for one. The memory and battery life is much better than her last iPhone so she now has all her apps running -(whatever they are - a phone to me is to call or text people) - apparently I'm behind the times The camera is excellent as is the sound quality - this is tje best one yet.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2022,8

Minor upgrade,"Apart from the marginal improvement in picture quality, I can’t see any big upgrade from the 12. Considering the money they cost, I was expecting much more. Battery life is good at the moment but considering apples track record with them deteriorating after a few years, it remains to be seen.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 March 2022,8
the phone wouldn't set up,The phone wouldn't set up or recognise my Apple ID so had to be returned.I bought insurance with it which is a mistake that requires a different conversation direct with Apple.as masssive pain in the A**S all round,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 March 2022,8
A significant improvement over the 12.,"Before we start, apologies for the long review, but I hope it's useful!So another year and another iPhone has launched. Now, I have to admit I didn't intend to buy this year, having had the 12 until now. However nearly having my phone stolen and dropped by the errant thief as he stumbled away, it needed significant repair.....that my insurance company completed very badly. It was then lost in transit on the way back to me after the second repair. So a new phone was in order.Many of you, who are in the market for a new phone, have probably done some research, watched a few videos or maybe are just mulling over the final decision, so I'll give you a few key areas that I feel are worth the outlay.Aesthetics:Very little has changed in this regard since the 12, but I feel that is no bad thing. Love or hate the design, it's bold, sharp and well proportioned. One thing that may interest you is that the hue of the red and black devices has changed. The black is far deeper and richer and looks much better than last years. The red is also a lot more saturated and deep. A nice improvement.Accessories:Contrary to a lot of websites, the vast majority of 12 cases don't fit. This is because the camera bump is now dimensionally different and has slightly moved position on the back of the device. The device is also a few mm thicker which makes a difference in a form fitting case. Just a thing to be aware of, in case the similarities of the last 2 phones make you think they would be cross compatible.Battery life:Now, Apple has said that the 13 offers 2.5 hours additional battery life over the 12. While I can't give a scientific response to this, I can say that where my previous phone (even when new) would have the low battery warning appear, the 13 still normally has another 10-15% juice left in the tank. This is very helpful to me, as I travel a lot for work, and having to constantly find a charger or remembering to charge a powerbank is often frustrating.Storage:I'm so happy that Apple have now decided that the base storage needs to be increased, as the 12's base of 64GB was stingy to say the least. I always get the 128GB, which is now the base model with the 13, this is adequate for my needs. For reference, I currently have 82 apps, 590 downloaded songs from Spotify & 104 pictures in my 128GB 13, and I still have 98GB free. Even if it was lower, I use an iPad & Mac, so I have iCloud for a lot of storage outside of what's on my phone, so I never really run out. Your mileage will vary, but I don't need more than that, so win win for me.Screen quality:The 13 has a considerably higher peak screen brightness than the proceeding models. I used my 12 in the middle east in the burning sun while working away and found the screen was plenty bright enough, so I can't comment on the improvement. BUT, my father has cataracts which do impede his sight, and he finds the 13 screen easier to use by increasing the brightness, so I guess there is a silver cloud to those with sight loss or other occular impairment!Performance:One thing Apple always does right. My iPhone X was still buttery smooth after 2.5 years of heavy use, and my 12 was until it's impending doom. The 13 feels fast, fluid and up to speed and I have no doubt this will continue over time.Camera:The 13 now has a new cinematic mode for video, a wider lens on its ultra wide camera & it's night mode is improved by its sensor being able to use even more light than last years 12. It now also has optical image stabilisation on the sensor rather than the lens, which helps stability. While I can't say exactly how much better it is in use, I can tell you that the photos I have taken so far are crisp, punchy and perfectly useable. I have no complaints there!Conclusion....Overall, despite my intention to not buy in this year, I'm glad I did. The changes are evolutionarily rather than revolutionary, but they have taken a very good phone to a higher level. The biggest plus for me is the improved battery life, which can make all the difference on a day to day level. If you are in the market for a new phone and like the range, I'd not hesitate in recommending it!I hope this review was useful to you, if so please hit the helpful button and let me know, as I do them to help others find the best products for them. Stay well and enjoy!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 October 2021,1
Features going backwards,"I was forced to upgrade from an ageing iPhone 6s because the battery life had completely died, which I am convinced was almost entirely a function of software. Strange how after every update the battery performance deteriorated.The battery life is good. Pretty much everything else is a big step backwards. There is no fingerprint recognition anymore. It's Face ID. Doesn't work with a facemask which we have to wear these days. Doesn't work with my banking app.They got rid of the home button and have otherwise messed around with the OS. I struggle to access basic features now. You need to flick up or down at just the right place in just the right way rather than just pressing a button.They no longer bother to include a charger, so you need to buy that separately. They got rid of the headphone socket. So you can buy bulky bluetooth earbuds with limited battery life, or pay extra for an adapter, which is what I did.I bought an Apple silicone case. It slightly obstructs the lightning socket to the extent my charger cable won't fit. So every day I need to remove the case to charge it and then put it back on in the morning.On paper the specs are doubtless far superior to my 6s. But in practical terms, before they nixed my battery, the 6s did everything I needed with no fuss. This 13 has lost identifiable features: home button, headphone socket, charger, fingerprint scanner - with no compensation.How long before Apple decides I need to buy another phone and forces an OS update on me that nerfs my battery life?",2.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 October 2021,1
"Looks and performs perfectly, No issues as of now!","Upgraded from an ( iPhone 8 plus)This New iPhone 13 (product red) Looks and feels great!-(CAMERA) The camera quality is outstanding, And the ultra wide lense is an extra bonus when needing to take them Wide angle shots.

Phone 13 is a disguised iPhone 12S.,"Ended up returning it - I’ve literally nothing more to say other than it's a small upgrade over iPhone 11, and an even smaller one over iPhone 12.Not worth the money at all.

Touchscreen issue forced return,"I decided to make the switch from Android as I was tempted by the excellent camera and premium brand/design.I was a little sad about forfeiting fingerprint ID, 120hz screen & excellent battery life but I need a great camera for work so on balance I went for it.I was disappointed I did. I can't believe a premium phone like this, costing double what my Android did, shipped with a faulty touch screen! It was as if I wasn't touching/tapping it and it was so bad I was intermittently unable to use the phone at all. I literally had to wait, put it down and come back to it, until it was willing to respond. I was okay with the downgrade the other features I mentioned but the touchscreen was kinda essential and therefore a deal-breaker!Thankfully Amazon are arranging a return & refund due the faulty touchscreen. Excellent service there.On the plus side, the photos I took while I had it were excellent as expected and the battery life was noticeably much better than previous iPhones I've used. The AMOLED screen was excellent.I can't comment on the accuracy of Face ID as I was wearing a mask most of the time and had to put my pin in whenever unlocking.If you're coming from an old iPhone you'll love it (if your coming from a nice Android you won't know the difference).",3.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 October 2021,1

Worst I phone ever,The design reminds of I phone 4. The resolution is improved comparing to my iPhone 11 but feels more bulky in my palm than I phone 11. It arrived without a charger- ?!!!! Nearly 800 pounds for a new phone to buy additionally a charger - I don’t get it. And here comes the nightmare - the battery last a day if not less moderate use - absolutely disgraceful. I will definitely not recommend this product,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2022,1
Wow brilliant phone!,"Upgraded my Iphone SE 2020 for this. It's so powerful - great longer battery life and so much faster......By no means cheap, but it feels much more robust in the hand, has twice the storage capacity too at 128GB, and looks amazing. I'm not too fussed about the apparently great camera but I guess that will be nice too! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2021,1

The iPhone 13 has the same wide camera lens as the iPhone 12 Pro Max,"The iPhone 13 has the same design as last year’s iPhone 12 model, but it's internally where the differences can be found. One of the key internal changes being an improved camera where Apple have taken last year’s much praised iPhone 12 Pro Max wide camera lens and put it into the iPhone 13... and the images are fantastic!Another key improvement is Apples new A15 bionic chip with a 6 core CPU, 4 core GPU and 4Gb of RAM (in the iPhone 13). Currently, the A15 Bionic chip is the fastest smartphone chip in the world meaning it can handle the most demanding apps/processes and still has room to spare.It also means Apple will continue to support the iPhone 13 with software (iOS) updates for 5 to 6 years, longer than any other smartphone manufacturer. so if you are looking for a future proof, then that's what you will be doing by buying this.The battery is also very good. I'm not a heavy phone user but I've become accustomed to ensuring I have a charger close by 'in case' I need it, whereas with the iPhone 13 I'm comfortably getting through the day without needing to charge it... and on a several occasions into the next day too.The main differences between the iPhone 13 and iPhone Pro, or Pro Max, are:- Graphics: The iPhone 13 has a 4 core GPU where the Pro has a 5 core GPU- Display: The iPhone 13 has a 60Hz refresh display where the Pro has ProMotion, an adaptive display which ranges from 10 to 120Hz depending on what you are looking at or doing- Battery: The iPhone 13 has an estimated 15 hours of continuous streaming and the Pro as 20 hours- Camera: The iPhone 13 has a Wide Camera lens and an Ultra-Wide camera lens, where the Pro has a Wide, Ultra-Wide and a Telephoto camera lens.The Pro models also have macro photography thanks to a new Ultra-Wide camera lens which take stunning images.Overall, the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and ideal for anyone wanting to:a) Upgrade from a phone older than the iPhone 11b) Looking for the most future proof smart phone they can getc) Are not fussed by telephoto or macro photographyLastly, I’ve attached 5 photo examples of Photographic Styles, new feature to the iPhone 13 range.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 November 2021,9

Brilliant phone,"This is my first iPhone after years of Android use. iOS is quite different, but it works fine, once you wrap your head around it. The phone itself is excellent. Beautiful to look at and listen to, incidentally. Great camera, fairly lightweight and it feels well made. It definitely lives up to the hype. Clever too that if it’s close to my iPad or MacBook, I can make or receive calls on any of them. A few foibles. You can’t just start typing a name on the phone keypad to bring up a number, Android style, and it took me a while to realise you need to press and hold to move the cursor when you’re editing text like this review. But it’s minor stuff. If you can stomach the price (which was considerably discounted here - thanks, Amazon), then you won’t be disappointed.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 April 2022,9

Slick,"Only purchased after my Xs max was stolen, wanted to wait till iPhone 14 but having said that this version is a definite improvement over my previous model super slick better screen although slightly smaller (not being a max) battery lasts a couple of days between charges, I would say I’m a light to medium user I don’t use Facebook or the likes just a few what’s app messages Apple Music safari surfing & checking my share prices & call the wife on the way home.Have always used apple products for ease of use I have no problem being locked into their ecosystem & have no intention of moving to android.Would definitely recommend this model, just make sure you get a good case to protect it the screen repair prices are painful.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 March 2022,2
Nice red phone,"Battery life is great <U+0001F44D>, it’s a nice red never had a red phone before, so easy to use and set up, I didn’t get the phone because of the camera I have a camera to take pictures but it’s good to have when you go out, but can’t do too much of that with COVID and the new variant, and it’s 5G I have 5G so thought I would get it, and it’s much lighter than my iPhone 11 so comfortable in my hand, very happy with my new phone",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 December 2021,2

5G battery <U+0001F50B>,"Recently i upgrade to iPhone 13 pro. I have been using this from 5 days. Battery is something I’m not really convinced with it. This is the first time I had this experience I bought a new product and the batter is not really up to the make. May be it’s because of the 5G. But it is bit disappointing, we can’t live in fear we have turn in dark mode, make changes in location, look for videos on YouTube how save battery. Camera quality, built quickly software easy to use iOS15. That’s my honest review about iPhone 13pro 256gb",4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 September 2021,7
Buy the iPhone 13 not the max,I bought this as my iPhone 7 stopped working and here are the reasons I bought a iPhone 13 over the pro and max.Apple ui looks so much better than android.You don’t need a better camera when it’s almost twice the price in the pro or max.120hz display isn’t worth the extra price.Smaller phone is better to hold and use than the max.128gb is enough storage for most people.ProsIt’s FastFast charging with 20w charger.Great UINice new camerasBigger screenCan connect external storage5GSmaller notchPicture in PictureSplit screen appsConsNo charger given to you.No Matt coloursNo telephotoNo 6x optical zoomNo night mode scanner4 not 5 GPUSmaller battery than the Pro maxNo Touch ID instead you have stupid Face IDNo promotion displayNo 3rd cameraNo pro resSoftware updates only last for 7 yearsBattery will need replacing after 3 yearsNo usb cAlthough I’ve listed the cons I think the iPhone is still the best phone that you can buy and you will use every day but I’d get the standard iPhone 13 because the max and pro are a rip off the price has become to high for very little extra features compared with the standard phone.And like all smart phones there’s nothing much new each year it’s just new software that improves the features so if you can wait another year buy the iPhone 14 which will possibly have the following.USB cTouch idNo notch screenBattery cameras,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2021,7
Almost perfection.,"Whilst it may be an incremental upgrade over the 12 three key areas have been substantially improved; storage, battery and camera. Face ID still the best. Perfect size - not a slab. It's the overall best phone with a sensibly-sized form factor. The negatives? In an era of 65W charging by the likes Of OnePlus the iPhone charges at a snail's pace - wirelessly it's ridiculously slow. 1200 Htz screen refresh only available on Pro models. Still no USB-C charging. Whilst smaller, the notch is beginning to look ridiculous. No fingerprint reader.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 December 2021,7

Having a mobile you can rely for n.,Amazon only offered a repair not a replacement. I have lost confidence in this mobile so I hope they don’t send the mobile back has I would like a brand new phone. Lost trust in that old phone only had this since end of November. Not used till 11 December problems with it since out of the box.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 February 2022,5
