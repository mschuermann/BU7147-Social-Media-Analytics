"amazing iphone","The phone itself arrived with extremely small and unnoticeable scratches, the rest of it was perfect. The camera is super high-quality and I didn’t notice any issues with setting it up. Everything works perfectly and I’m extremely excited about my new iPhone. It comes with a charger brick and a charger along with the Sim card remover.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2022",1
"Perfect Phone","The phone arrived earlier than expected , and it was perfect. It is unlocked . It didn’t have one scratch or flaw. AND I GOT A CHARGING BRICK TOO! I’ve only had it for a few days though so I will continue using it to see if there are any problems . But besides that , everything is perfect !","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2022",1

"Perfect!","I WAS skeptical about getting a renewed phone.. but it’s perfect. Literally like it came out of a store brand new. No cosmetic defects or hardware issues I’ve found so far. I am very impressed.I will update as time goes on if anything is found.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2022",1

"iPhone 13 disappointing, should have kept XS","First I’ll say that I like the MagSafe chargers that are also available on the 12, besides that this phone is worse than the XS. The camera is not good at taking close ups, the battery lasts a day if I have it on low power mode and close apps I’m not using. 5G is obviously not ready for the public and I’ve never had to restart my phones this often either.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2022",1
"Great phone but Face ID does not work.","This phone is in perfect condition as far as I can tell. The only issue I’ve had so far is I am not able to use Face ID.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2022",1
"If you have an iphone X or older, it's worth it to upgrade.","Great battery life + 5G capability. Big improvement from the very good iphone XIf you have a 12, maybe wait (unless your battery is weakening).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2022",1
