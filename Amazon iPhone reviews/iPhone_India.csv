Buy only if you like Apple EcoSystem and you have a Price Constraint,"tl;dr:If you can spend more money and want a better camera go with Pro or ProMaxIf you like the Apple EcoSystem you can get this else stick to AndroidPros :1. Good Display / Brightness (Supports Dark mode and You can control White Tone which is nice). It has 60Hz refresh rate but you won't feel the difference imho2. Good Battery Life (iPhone 13 Series has good battery life but ensure you have a supported charger) I use my MacBook's charger which charges the phone pretty quickly.3. Best Privacy Control4. Camera in Portrait Mode and Selfie Camera (LiveText Detection is a nice feature)5. Fast Processor / RAM management is good6. Great Resale value / Apple SupportCons:1. Screen size (6.1"" which is less in this price segment)2. Optical Zoom in 13 is not great (If you want a camera phone go with Pro or Pro Max or Android alternative)3. Third Party App Size is Huge (Gmail is 300MB / YouTube 250 MB). No native app lock option4. Very Less OS customizations / No Fingerprint Scanner (hopeful this gets better with iOS 16)5. No Native Support for mkv and other video formats (you can download a third party though)6. Native iOS Apps either require a subscription or are paid.7. File Management is restricted / Not easy to download *multiple* files from Telegram / Drive",3.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 20 March 2022,37

Premium class and a different league altogether,"Writing this review after a week usage.I went for the iPhone 13 Green Variant which got recently released. I must confess that this Phone is totally worth every penny. Quality & Smooth interface, Impressive Battery life with moderate/heavy use, Bright Bezel HD Display, fanstastic speakers with Clear sound quality, and The Apple OS make this Phone a real asset to possess. I am quite happy and satisfied with my iPhone 13.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 3 April 2022,37

AVOID AMAZON FOR APPLE PRODUCTS!,"Strongly recommend DO NOT BUY any apple products either airpods, ipads, mac, iphone or even apple pencil or charger from Amazon! Because even after the ""7 days replacement"" note on the seller or the product page, Amazon not gonna provide you a straight simple easy-going replacement at your door step.No matter what ever product you've received, duplicate or broken or even a empty box....They gonna straight send you to the service centre & after that service centre will guide you further! Amazon call it ""apple products policy"" they never mention! & You have to visit the service centre & collect documentation & whatever needed in between the replacement policy days!Remember service centre always tries to repair the product.& Even after that you not gonna have a straight easy refund!!When you finally have to visit the service centre for a return policy even if you get a duplicate or defective product, which not gonna happen from your home, then why to buy it from online & not from a retail store!?",1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 8 April 2022,37

Go for it..,"you really don't need to upgrade if you bought a new iPhone last year. But anyone with an iPhone 11 or older will find enough new parts and features to consider the new modelsScreenThe screen is notably better than last year's. It's the first iPhone with Apple's ProMotion display, a very high refresh-rate screen technology that was introduced on the iPad Pro in 2017.The screen can adjust to the content on the page to help save battery life and make things feel smoother. If you're just reading a website, for example, it might refresh less frequently and save battery life. But then if you're gaming or scrolling through a long webpage, it'll refresh really fast to make everything much smoother.BatteryBattery life is top-notch and lasts longer than any other iPhone on the market. Unless you're playing games for hours and hoursThat's thanks to a combination of a newer processor, a new screen and a bigger battery. I streamed nine hours of movies, for example, with just over 50% brightness, and still had more than half the battery left.CameraThe regular wide-angle, the zoom and the ultra-wide-angle lenses on the back now allow in more light, which means they're better at taking pictures in the dark.The HDR feature is also better in situations where your subject might have a lot of light behind them, which can normally make people in a picture look dark — all the iPhone 13 phones can keep color and detail even if the sun is right behind someone.You can get really close to an object, like a blueberry or a flower, and capture a lot of detail.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 25 September 2021,6

Not a great phone!,"I switched from Oneplus 5t to iPhone 13. The reasons I switched was 1. Battery life of Oneplus 5t deteriorated rapidly and OnePlus hardly cared to explain this. I also suspected that OnePlus deliberately created a bug that led to sudden drop in battery life. 2. Wanted to get an Android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues. 3. Oneplus device also suffered from Screenburn.Having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iPhones lack basic features such as1. Display of date and time on status bar2. The rounded edges of the phone create a problem as some apps with options at the bottom of the screen are not properly displayed.3. Amazon App does not allow purchase if Kindle books on iOS devices.4. Typing is a problem as the screen is smaller compared to a OnePlus device.Overall, I am neither too happy nor too sad with the purchase though I must confess that price of the phone seems exorbitant vis a vis the value delivered.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 20 February 2022,2

Little over priced but ok,"This is my first IPhonePhone looks and feels premium in hand, definitely you cannot compare with Chinese android phones.Battery is sufficient for normal day to day use, if you use hotspot then it will be drained in 5 hours, I don’t play games so can’t comment.Security, OS and hardware comprised intact kudos to apple for that, this is where iPhone stands out from other phones.Volume and camera is amazing and you feel next level if you are switching from Chinese smart phones. Same Dolby and oled display feels premium in iphone.Didn’t explore much on apple eco system, how ever I understood that you need to spend some extra bugs than usual if you want to be a premium user of apple eco system.Nothing comes for free here, in fact you would loose the freedom of being an android user (less customisation and no side loaders)In a good way, if you respect your privacy, security and getting premium services in the market you should choose iPhone.New users are good to go for iPhone 13 with few extra grands with the current offers, you will get extra features that are missing in 12.12 users forget about upgrading to 13 it will be a joke for you, it won’t worth it.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 8 February 2022,2

But this apple device shows only 1 bar and sometimes none. You can't do anything other than just looking at phone. I kept 9 pro and iphone 13 at the same place at the same time having airtel postpaid sim card inserted.

One of the best phones out there right now,So I ordered this phone from apple’s official website. And have been using this for the past 1 week and trust me it has one of the best batteries you will find on any phone. I am a moderate user when it comes to cellphones i.e the basic Instagram Facebook WhatsApp YouTube and Netflix. This phone if charged fully lasts up to 24 hours if used moderately without any heavy gaming.The reason I am writing this review is because of the useless comments of people that are rated high but can’t actually afford this phone.Coming from one plus 6t this phone is a huge jump (I love my one plus… still using it as my work phone) but it is obviously a lot to adjust to since we are completely switching to a different OS seems like shifting to a different nation all together.Anyway.. if you do have a good enough budget you should definitely go for this beauty,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 21 October 2021,22

Solid phone overall,"I was looking to buy a new smartphone after my POCO F1 started having issues. If you are someone like my who's looking to move from Android to iOS, don't think twice and go ahead with the purchase. I got the phone on release day and the experience so far has been hassle free. If you have any other Apple devices, then the decision is a no brainer since sum of the each part is greater than the individual ones. One thing Apple should work on is adding 120Hz screen and switch to Type C port. I'm more than happy with my purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 26 March 2022,39

Overrated Product!,"Apple Marketing has done quite a good job month after month to keep people on their toes with their new launches where there is nothing great about this phone. I have been on Android for almost inception of phones and switching to iPhone is just a pain.1. No guide or help to transfer your critical data(Move to iOS doesnt work at all with high amount of data transfer.If you want to buy, go to brick and motor shop and get your data transfer then and there.2. Over hyped phone, nothing great i have found in the phone. May be i will find it better.3. Total stuck with ecosystem.4. At 90K they don't provide charger and are selling the same as extra. Total cheap strategy to earn more and promote their magsafe.I am not a happy customer till now!

Truly worth the money spent! Even if you go broke!,"My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can’t believe what I’m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn’t disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and I’m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don’t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 6 February 2022,1
An white elephant. wth retrograde design. Cheap appearance,The look is retrograde . Feel is cheap. Does not have physical double SIM. The Airtel does not offer eSIM for prepaid connection. Fortunately jio revised an eSIM that got activated in 2hrs’.There is nothing so spectacular about the camera. The cinematic mode is good.This is my first exposure to iphone.Impression : As good as any high end handset. Android is really more user friendly.Battery life for a new hand set is just good.

Awesome,"First time I switched from android to ios . Yeah there is some points which I don’t like in ios but in aspect of phone (iPhone 13) I would say it’s fantastic. And battery backup is really gud I have used it for avg. 4hrs screen on time and it show 20% left after 48hrs. Rest camera is perfect.

Worth the product,"Though we talk a lot about high price for iPhones, this is worth the amount. Smooth touch, perfect to hold in hand. For the screen size of 6.1"", it looks small overall. I could have gone for pro max but more than 1.5L budget is way too much for me :-)* Good battery back-up (With low battery mode always on, 5 hours of talk-time, around 2 hours of twitter and 2 hours of whatsapp usage, 1 hour of songs listening, 1 hour of rummy/candy crush games and notification of all these items, the battery comes for more than 24 hours for me)* Getting charged quickly from 20% to 100% within 2 hours* Perfect camera and I love that 'Live' photo option* Body design is awesome. When I held it in my hand for the first time, felt really happy about the design and the size of the iPhone 13.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 11 March 2022,4

Outstanding,"Ignore the negative comments made by amateurs.Reasons for upgrade :1. Camera: Bigger camera aperture, OIS, cinematic mode. Low light pictures are outstanding as you can see the 2nd picture of the flower taken at night. Also some of the pictures during daylight for reference.2. Battery: Apple has really done a good job in battery management. It's giving a good battery back up.3. Processor: New A15 processor and better performance.4. Software: This is the usual strong point of any iPhone with iOS.5. Storage: Not to forget you’re now getting 128 gigs as base storage compared to 64 gigs last year on base model price.Who should buy this phone:1. If you're already using an iPhone 12 don't bother to upgrade. Wait for next year release.2. Those who are using iPhone 10 or previous versions can surely feel much of a difference.3. Price gap: Iphone 12 is 70,000 INR with no offers at present. Iphone 13 with 6000 discount on HDFC Cards makes the actual price around 74000. It makes no sense to save 4000 and buy an year old device iPhone 12 if you’re upgrading from iPhone 10 or previous versions.4. iPhone 12 purchase will only make sense compared to iPhone 13 if it's price gets reduced to 55000.Customer Expectations:1. At least an always on display.2. On display fingerprint scanner.3. A 90hz refresh rate if not 120hz for iPhone 13 model. In India we are paying a lot for base models.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 3 October 2021,29

"Hyped as well as expensive, minor upgrade over Iphone 12.","The smartphone marketplace has changed drastically over the span of the past few years. Over the years, it has become more competitive than ever before with a lot of smartphone makers launching their flagship devices every six months. Amid these challenging times Apple, like a bunch of other companies, has maintained a yearly update cycle for its iPhones. In this series, the company, as is customary, announced the iPhone 13 as its successor to last year’s iPhone 12.The newly launched iPhone 13 delivers minor upgrades over the iPhone 12, which includes a smarter camera, a brighter display, a bigger battery and of course, a more advanced processor to name a few. Then there are features like a smaller notch and a less pronounced rear camera module that might seem insignificant compared to the mentioned features but make a world of difference when it comes to usage. Sure, it’s a tad bit heavier than the iPhone 12 but if you compare it with some of the older iPhone models, like the iPhone 11 or the iPhone XR that I have been using, for what seems like aeons now, you will be grateful for everything that the iPhone 13 offers.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 22 December 2021,32
Iphone,"I switched from Oneplus 5t to iPhone 13. The reasons I switched was 1. Battery life of Oneplus 5t deteriorated rapidly and OnePlus hardly cared to explain this. I also suspected that OnePlus deliberately created a bug that led to sudden drop in battery life. 2. Wanted to get an Android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues. 3. Oneplus device also suffered from Screenburn.Having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iPhones lack basic features such as1. Display of date and time on status bar2. The rounded edges of the phone create a problem as some apps with options at the bottom of the screen are not properly displayed.3. Amazon App does not allow purchase if Kindle books on iOS devices.4. Typing is a problem as the screen is smaller compared to a OnePlus device.Overall, I am neither too happy nor too sad with the purchase though I must confess that price of the phone seems exorbitant vis a vis the value delivered.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 14 March 2022,32

Amazing phone. Skip the mini and buy this.,"iPhone 13 is an amazing phone.

Incredible Package,Was using 11 before this. Wanted to go for 13 pro. Wished 120 hertz pro motion display in my phone. But that costed way too much. Nevertheless this standard 13 model is not too behind. Almost same cameras. Amazing battery life and speakers. And build is similar to 12 offourse but functionality is better. Great changes from 12 especially in camera and battery. Perfect value smartphone in 72000<U+20B9> (128gb). IOS is IOS. Ecosystem is unmatched. Hence for me a perfect phone.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 8 December 2021,23
Improved Battery Life,"The biggest improvement I have noted is the battery life. It’s really good. Upgraded from my 7 plus after 4.6 years. Another thing I like is MagSafe charging. One of the main issue I face with my old phone was charging port failure due to dust accumulation. MagSafe charge helps from above said issue. Of course we have to pay for that extra. Even though am enjoying bigger battery ,the thickness increased a bit and it is bit annoying. My advice is it’s a highly paid model, so use it minimum 3 years.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 16 October 2021,23
Not Going Back to Android Mostly,"Long time android user here, I bought the iPhone 13 as a replacement of my android mid range and also to shoot Youtube videos as I think an iPhone offers better value than any 60-70k vlogging cam. Absolutely love the camera, battery backup, the build quality-just no words there. Unlike android, I do not have to worry for extended zoom and g calls--very reliable. Definitely, Apple got another long time iPhone customer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 6 January 2022,23
