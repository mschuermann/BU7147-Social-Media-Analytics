Ultra phone at ultra price! Worth it though <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FB>,"I have been using the phone since 10+ days now, and it's been a fantastic experience. This is my first S series phone, that also comes with S-Pen so first Note series as well <U+0001F600>.Performance:It's buttery smooth as expected from a flagship phone. RAM is pretty much occupied by system but I didn't found any issue while day to day use, and ain't a heavy user as well so can't comment about gaming performance.Battery: it doesn't feel like 5000 mah. Need to charge every morning, sometimes before sleeping at night. Hope Samsung fix it by software update.Camera:Tuning of camera is done very accurately by Samsung. Color levels, exposure, HDR..everything feels perfect. Zoom is extraordinary and perfectly usable till 30x-50x. Still haven't got opportunity for testing the camera in different environments, will update later for that.Accessories:I have applied Spigen screen protector on screen so fingerprint reader is working same as on naked screen, and S-Pen is also working fine I would say (Not smooth as on glass, but perfectly usable).Spigen Liquid Air cover is just perfect to hold the S22 ultra, as it provides extra grip on the sides.Even though it's costlier, I would recommend to buy who has budget for this ULTRA flagship. You will just love it!! <U+0001F60D>",4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 6 April 2022,9

Heating issue and battery drains very fast,"I have purchased this around 9th march and got it on 12th march, from the first day itself I am facing heating issue, first I thought because of data transfer it's getting hot.. after using for 2 week and facing the same issue again and again, by again and again means even I am using just fb or instagram, temperature goes to 38-40° Celsius normally. It's too hot to receive a call and put it on ear, I am using with speaker!! Really disappointed!! I will recommend you not to buy this bulshit!!

The best phone for photography...,"I bought the Phantom Black 512 GB variant of S22 Ultra. I pre-booked the device along with the Watch 4 offer. My net cost after all discounts and offers for the combo was Rs. 1.14 lakhs.RATINGS: OVERALL 9/10Camera: 10/10 (the best photography on a smartphone; for videos however, iPhone 13 Pro would be best though).Software: 9/10Display: 10/10Battery: 8/10Charging speed: 8/10Sound and Haptics: 7/10Performance: 9/10Features: 9/10Call quality: 8/10Heating: 10/10 (didn't see any heating issue with my limited use so far; haven't played games yet)Ultrasonic Fingerprint Scanner: 10/10 (it is impressively fast and accurate)Face Unlock: 9/10 (it is superfast in well lit environments, but doesn't work in dark environments)Here's my review after 2 days of use:CONS1. This is a 2 handed phone. It is big and you'll be uncomfortable using it with one hand. I wish the phone was slightly narrower and came with a grippy sandstone case.2. No pre-installed screen protector. I don't think you'll find a perfectly fitting screen protector either due to the curved edges.3. Battery life is just okay. I get about 5 to 6 hours SOT on a full charge.4. Charging speed is just okay. I bought the Samsung 45W Travel adapter and it takes about 1.5 hours to fully charge the device. This is pretty slow compared to what we see with OnePlus/ Xiaomi/ Oppo/ Vivo phones.5. No charger or earphones in the box. Only the phone and a Charging cable (tpye C to type C) is provided.6. Phantom White in 512 GB is not available in India (only 256 GB is available). I wanted it, but had to settle with the Black option. Some reviewers say that the Black variant gets scratched easily for some reason, so keep that in mind.7. OneUI doesn't use Material You theme of Android 12 in it's full glory. Some people may like it, some would prefer the stock Android feel as seen on Pixel and Motorola devices. It's not bad though, but just not a refreshing change. So putting it in CONS section.8. Status bar icons are not too customizable.9. Curved Display: This has no practical use. They only look good on marketing materials. When you are actually using the phone, there is absolutely no benefit. On the contrary, content gets bent at the edges and not great especially when watching videos or photos.PROS1. The best camera on a smartphone for photography. For videos however, iPhone 13 Pro is best. I bought this phone primarily for 2 reasons: the cameras, and the S-Pen which comes with it's own housing.2. S-Pen: Only phone with the pen feature.3. The best Display on a smartphone. I have kept the default FHD+ resolution (120 Hz adaptive refresh rate) just because there is hardly any difference you'll notice between FHD+ and WQHD+ on a small screen, and also because there is hardly any content that is of such high resolution. So I switched back to the default setting to prolong battery life.4. Feature rich software: This has both plus and minus points. Minus because more and more features means more chance of bugs and device slowing down due to bloatware. It also consumes battery. On the positive side, you can do a lot of things, although much of it is fancy, non-essential stuff.5. One handed use option (software feature) is very nice.6. Switching between light and dark themes is very smooth along with adaptive pallette selection.7. Phone has built-in call recording feature (atleast in India) without the stupid voice announcement.8. Performance is very good. No heating issues or throttling so far.9. This is the first time that Samsung has brought the Snapdragon chip model to India. Based on reviews, it is better than the Exynos variant just as in previous years.10. Both Face Unlock and under display ultrasonic Fingerprint scanner are SUPERFAST. Although in dark environments, face unlock struggles to unlock the phone. Using the Fingerprint is better in dark environments.I got two cases: Spigen Thin Fit and Caseology Parallex (a Spigen sub-brand). They fit perfectly, without adding bulk to the device.I haven't found a screen protector yet that would fit perfectly without bubbles at the edges.So that sums up my experience with the phone over 2 days of use. Hope this helps you with your choice of smartphone.EDIT: I had pre-booked the device on the 5th of March and it was delivered to me on the 17th of March, even though deliveries began on the 12th itself. My complaint is w.r.t the fact that the exact same variant was available with 1 day delivery to my pincode starting from the 12th. So anyone who ordered between 11th to 15th would have received their delivery within a day, earlier than me. This is unfair because seller has to service orders on a first-come-first-served basis. I can't accept someone ordering upto 10 days after me to get his order before me.But I will keep this in mind next time I want to pre-book on Amazon. When I enquired about it, customer service told me that I got it at a discount. That's a terrible explanation because there was no indication of that when I pre-booked the device. The offline stores were offering pretty much the same deal. Had I gone with an offline purchase, i would have got it much earlier for the same price, plus I need not have worried about the product getting damaged during transit. I mean I can inspect the box and make a decision before purchase at an offline store. The box I received had a few minor damages, although everything inside was fine.Expect delays in deliveries if you pre-book an item on Amazon, even if the item is in stock and available for delivery to your pincode by the same seller.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 4 April 2022,8

5 star experience,"Coming form Oneplus devices for the last 5 years, S22 ultra is truly a 5 star experience. Everything about this phone feels premium. There are so many settings and customization options that I am yet to discover them all. Plus I got the Watch-4 for almost nothing.....one extra star for that.Initially the phone will heat up a bit during charging and battery would seem like discharging within no time.

Not Worth The Price,"It's way too costly in return what you get.Pro'sPowerful DeviceCamera quality is unmatchableBest DisplayCon'sBattery optimisation is pathetic - Doesn't last a day even with avg use. On Screen time: 2-3 Hours only. You will have to charge it twice a day.A bit slippery in hands if used without case.Finger Print Sensor: There is no match to the physical finger print sensors used on S9 series on rear side. camera module supported finger print sensors are buggy and doesn't work always. Accuracy rate is not more than 70% on this one. Also the position is not ergonomic, side mounted or rear mounted finger print sensor would have been more easy to reach out while maintaining your grip on phone to hold it.No SD Card - 2 mini slots + eSIM support literally gives you an option to have 4 SIM's at the same time (not sure whether all can work) but its a sheer wastage of precious space on the phone design which could have been utilzed otherwise for an SD card slot. It's a complete foolishness to provide 2 physical SIM slots along with 2 eSIM card support.Bloatware - Not much, but there are unnecessary apps that you can get rid of, you can't disable them. Example: Google Messages & Samsung SMS app. Both are hard coded and you can't disable Samsung SMS app.Facebook app installer and Facebook services, Microsoft Swift Keyboard + Samsung Keyboard.In nutshell there are few apps that are a substitute to each other and not allowing to uninstall/disable them is a complete foolishness again that will sip battery and occupy storage on phone that doesn't have an SD card.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 31 March 2022,4
Beyond expectations. A true flagship. Samsung has finally nailed it.,"Pre-Ordered it on 3rd March 2022.Received it as promised on 11th March alongwith the Galaxy Watch 4, 44mm.Had been using the One Plus flagships since 2017.Initially , I was skeptical about Samsung devices due to the bloatware and other issues.However, I decided to take the leap to this device after much deliberation and narrowed doewn to the iPhone 13 pro max and S22 Ultra.I already have the Tab S7Fe and am very happy with the performance.Coming to the smartphone, the device received was the phantom black 12gb ram,256 gb variant.Amazing finish and build quality.I found it to be a bit heavy and bulky initially, but after a while, got used to it.It is a large device and not advisable for people with small hands.I would like to break up my review in two parts.Pros and Cons.Pros:1. Amazing performance from the SD 8Gen1 chipset.No lags or glitches whatsoever. A true flagship with industry leading processing power. The RAM plus feature is good.2. Amazing battery life. - some people will complain about mediocre battery life. But I have had no issues so far. The battery needs to optimise the apps. And after about 1 week of use and 2 updates later, the battery performance has improved. Getting almost 2 days of battery life with the 120hz adaptive mode and QHD+ resolution always on.3. Stunning display.-Samsung has always been the unbeaten champion of display tech and has once again nailed it with this QHD+ display.The colour reproduction and accuracy is immaculate and precise. The superbright screen is easily readable in direct sunlight and no screen bleeding or inconsistent color observed.The adaptive brightness works flawlessly.4. Virtual RAM works wonders. The already adequate 12 gb of ram is complemented by the virtual ram feature and is a boon for multi tasking and gaming.5. S-Pen features. I have always been a die-hard fan of the S-pen and have craved to use a flagship device having the feature for my daily work and gaming use. The S-pen is very useful in jotting down notes,as a magnifier, as a doodle, as a selfie stick and adds to the convenience.6.Super versatile camera performance.The camera performance is absolutely spot on.Be it point and shoot, portrait mode ,selfie, video recording, pro-mode or the slow motion shooting,Bring it on. The versatility offered is unbelievable. Apple needs to upgrade from the 12 mp hardware and learn to deliver better hardware in lieu of tweaking the image post capture like Samsung. Details captured and the stunning portraits are proof of Samsung image processing with optimised hardware and software experience.7. Valie for money and bang for your buck.I pre ordered the S22 Ultra and the Galaxy Watch4, 44mm and got a very good deal on Amazon for <U+20B9>.1.08 lakhs.Had I opted for the apple ecosystem, the total cost would have gone up to <U+20B9>.1.50 lakhs.The Galaxy ecosystem is evolving and the level of customisation is wat better than iOS ecosystem, although there is a huge scope of improvement.8. Samsung updates: I was concerned about the android updates as Samsung was notorious for non-updation of their old flagships. However, I was relieved to find out that Samsung has promised 4 years of updates. So that is a real peace of mind. And my device has already received 2 software ,firmware and security patch updates via OTA.Cons:1. One UI. The most irritating part is Non availability of Google voice assistant. Everytime I try to use the voice assistant, the Bixby routine assistant is prompted. Samsung must go ahead and drop it's Bixby assistant which is not as optimised and versatile as Google assistant.2. Curved screen. In a way the screen is immaculate and accidental touches are avoided if we switch on the accidental touch option. But curved screens are a headache and prone to accidental touches. I so miss the flat screen on my One Plus 7T.3. App drawer horizontal navigation.The app drawer just cannot be modified to scroll vertically. I downloaded the good lock app and the home up drawer customisation is not up to the mark. Samsung needs to optimise this.4. The Galaxy app store needs to be synchronized with Google Play store so that unnecessary pop-ups and useless apps are not recommended.5. Heavy animations consume battery life and need to be disabled manually.6. Option of 4k video @30fps needs to be enabled manually.All said and done, I am fully satisfied with my purchase and I must thank Samsung for making this amazing device as a combination of the note and s series and also kudos to Amazon for facilitating my purchase.Thanks and regards.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 7 April 2022,4

Best of Samsung,"Firstly, coming from iPhone, I found camera to be way too superior compared to iPhone. Especially when it comes to zooming clicks.When it comes to ease of use, it's good overall. But OS smoothness is not that good compared to OnePlus's Oxygen OS. Apps download and installation takes a lot of time when compared to iPhone and OnePlus.There have been several events where I found apps close down automatically when you start using them. Maybe a software update might help on this. There have been events where the phone has lagged as well.Earlier I had OnePlus 7T Pro 2 years back and that phone was damn smooth and never did it lag at all not did any of the apps crashed u like Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.These were few instances where this phone has disappointed me quite a bit. All these issues can be resolved via software update. So hoping Samsung team might look into it and do the needful.Design is stunning and so is the S Pen.This phone has great aesthetics of how a super phone design should be. Now my mom uses my OnePlus 7T Pro phone and occasionally when I use it, it's too fast even being on Android 11. So, come on Samsung and fix the bugs. We have put so much of trust and money in this phone so we deserve the best experience from the phone of such a name.Rest, I will update my review after I get an OS update to see if the bugs are removed.Thanks!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 28 March 2022,3

Android doesn't get any better than this.,"I've always wanted to get a S Series flagship. I have always wanted to get a Note Series flagship. Now I have both of them in the S22 Ultra.After a long wait, Samsung finally merged the S and Note series which was inevitable and I am glad they did.The S22 Ultra is the phone to beat this year. Samsung launched the S series earlier than expected and we have already got a phone of the year contender 3 months into the year. Don't think it gets any better than this no matter what flagship any competition introduces.Before this, I was using One Plus 7 Pro and the S22 Ultra makes it feel like a Xiaomi phone. I was not ready to be blown away considering that OP7P is a pretty good phone to begin with. But it improves on every aspect of a 2-3 year old flagship and this is Android at it's peak (until Samsung comes out with another banger next year)It goes without saying that the camera on S22 Ultra is the highlight followed by the S-Pen. And the conversation cannot be considered over until we mention the 100x zoom. I am amazed every time I do comparison shots where I take a normal picture and then a 100x zoom and find a detail which is not possible to see with the naked eye. I'll let you be the judge after going through the pictures I have uploaded (the pigeon vs the park).The display puts other mobile based OLED screens to shame. It is difficult to describe in words and you will have to see it for yourself, but the colors, sharpness of the text, adaptive refresh rate, QHD+ resolution is a sight to behold if you don't care about the battery life (which I don't) and I chose to not make any compromises with my experience of using this phone.The S-Pen which a lot of people have said to be a gimmick is a very nice addition and I find myself using it more often than not while browsing internet or simply watching YouTube. I really like the ""Smart Select"" feature which enables you to take screenshots and crop pictures on the fly. Definitely been using it a lot more than I should.There are a lot more detailed reviews out there which would tell you the specs and other features, but you probably don't need to know all the technical aspects of it. All you need to know is this is a- Snapdragon version- Has an updated GPU (gaming performance has vastly improved if you are into mobile gaming)- S-Pen latency has vastly improved- 45W fast charging (get a charging brick from Samsung, or any reputed third party like Spigen)All in all, if money is not an object and you want a phone which provides an uncompromising experience. This is the way.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 11 March 2022,1
A great phone to restart broken relationship,"I have had my relationship broken with Samsung 12 years ago because of the unethical behaviour of their service center staff. The staff broke my phone after an argument when they were not able to fix an issue in the new phone even after 3 visits. And, Samsung did nothing even after filing a complaint.In last 12 years I have used 14 major flagship devices from different companies. But didn't bought any Samsung goods.Today, after 12 years I dicided to give second and last chance to Samsung. Pre-booked this phone. Hope this will be good experience now.Here is my observation after using this device a few days.Pros:1. Awesome build quality.2. Camera (and zoom) is next level3. Speakers are loud with quality sound.4. Good network modem. My iPhone 13 struggles to get network coverage inside the home but there are full signals in Samsung phone from the same network operator.5. S pen is great addition to the S series and it works really well and fast.6. Display is really smooth and awesome7. Very touch sensitive.8. One UI seems to be promising.9. And finally, it does include the Snapdragon processor in India unit this time instead their inferior Exynos processor which helps in improving battery life and image processing.Cons:1. Doesn't come up with charging adapter. In the name of environment they fool customers to buy chargers saperately to make some extra bucks.2. Having a case inside box would have been nice like OnePlus provides one.3. There was no screen protector applied to tne display. So if you want to protect screen from the day 1, buy 1 screen protector along with the phone.4. Slower than last gen OnePlus 9 pro (12GB - 256GB). I compared keeping them side by side and disappointed by the Samsung in terms of App installation speed and gaming performance.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 12 March 2022,1

But battery life and overheating might put you in trouble if you are a heavy user.So go for it or not?That depends,if you want value for money then go for Pixel 6 Pro. This one its the best you can get for this heavy price. But according to features like S Pen and camera this one is also good.

There maybe phones out there that excel in one area or another, but this mobile is so good at everything, it is hard to compare it to anything out there as a total package.

The complete package,"The S22 Ultra is easily the most powerful and versatile Android phone on the market right now.From the gorgeous crisp display to the ridiculously stunning camera & haptics, every small feature, is as good as it gets!Right off the bat, the build quality feels premium and I've been a fan of the minimalist camera cutouts from the start, even though it does gather some dust...Coming to the S-pen, originally I thought it would be a ""good to have"" gadget, which I'd forget about eventually, but BOY was I wrong...The ability to take notes is a nifty feature for sure, but it doesn't end there.... From air gestures to smart select to translate, its honestly insane how much this small tool can accomplish, and I haven't even scratched the surface of its capabilities.The performance from Snapdragon 8 gen 1 (rather than the Exynos) is unbeatable.I wasn't a fan of One UI in the past but I am surprised at how much they've managed to polish it up with One UI 4.Plus, if you want to customize your phone even further, make sure you install the Good Lock app by Samsung, it opens up a whole new world for the tinkerers like me :)The only gripe I have is with the battery. Its not the best out there, but considering the performance you're getting in return, its more than fair to cut it some slack.All in all, yes, its pricey.

Truly Ultra To Rule Every Other Phone - Epitome of Innovation,"The media could not be loaded. This is truly the best phone money can buy, especially if you are already in the Android ecosystem. The S22 Ultra is an amped-up Galaxy Note with a faster S Pen built in, lots of camera improvements, a brighter display and faster charging.This is a stellar phone overall. S Pen is more responsive, as Samsung made it 70% faster with less latency.Galaxy S22 Ultra's biggest upgrades come with its cameras, as Samsung is shooting to overtake the iPhone 13 Pro Max and Google Pixel 6 Pro as the best camera phone.Key features I love:Best phone display yet: The Galaxy S22 Ultra's AMOLED panel is not only brighter than the competition, making it ideal for outdoor viewing, it delivers better color saturation.The S Pen is better: By reducing the latency by 70%, writing and drawing on the Galaxy S22 Ultra feels as smooth as pen and paper. And there's a holster built in.Better photos (especially in low light): Thanks to a bigger main sensor, the Galaxy S22 Ultra delivers brighter pictures than the S21 Ultra, and the Night Mode works even better than the iPhone 13 Pro Max in certain scenarios.Longer support: Samsung is promising five years of update support and four years of major OS updates, so this flagship should be able to last you a long time.Sleek and durable design: The Galaxy S22 Ultra is protected by an armor aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus+ back, and yet it's lighter than the iPhone 13 Pro Max without a lame notch. Some may not dig the curved display, though.45W charging is fast (but not that fast): The phone got to 67% in 30 minutes, which is not that much faster than 25W (58%).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 6 April 2022,10

A fantastic top tier Smartphone,"I was in a dilemma before purchasing the S22 Ultra, whether to buy the samsung or to go for the iPhone 13 Pro. I was not a big fan of the Apple's walled Garden approach to their ecosystem and not a big fan of iOS either but during a short period of use i really liked the iPhone 13Pro. But i loved the Android, its flexibility and Samsungs extremely customizable One UI. So i took a leap of faith and pre-ordered the Ultra. And until now from the minute i unboxed this beast of a Phone (the charger situation aside), it never disappointed me. Perfomace is superb, cameras are outstanding, low light performance of the cameras are out of the world. Battery life is more than enough. One UI is beautiful , fluent and buttery smooth. Speakers are fantastic. I did not find any issue of overheating even after heavy sessions of gaming. But the phone gets a little warm. Thats all. Okay...! Now some of the Cons1. I am coming from a OnePlus 6, and when comparing with that phone, this one is heavy.2. Some pre-installed Samsung apps have all the permissions and notifications allowed which we cant change, uninstall or disable.3. When it comes to Video recording, Samsung still cant beat its Notched Rivals. They still outclass the Ultra by a huge margin.4. Another annoying thing. Long press of the power button wakes Bixby up by default. Although we can disable bixby, samsung wont allow us to set it to summon the Google assistant.If samsung keeps its promise of 4 years of major updates and 5 years of security patches for its top end phones, one can use this phone for more that 3 years easily if you have a habbit of holding on to a phone for that long. And i am Super satisfied with my decision to purchase this phone.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 1 April 2022,10

Best of the best.,"The phone is a beast no questions asked. It worth the every penny you spend. Everything is above the scale:- fast, Snappy.Design is what stood out the most for me though its not much of a difference from it predeccssor still its feels out of the box to hold.Performance is as it should be, best in the game, With Snapdragon 8 gen 1 processor there is alot of a talk about heating however there is no such case with this phone. No matter how heavy user you are or how intense gaming you do this phone handles it all with a ease.Camera:- When i purchased this phone i was really looking forward to experience the camera it offers, If you compare this with best in market iphone 13 pro max, then you wont be disappointed, it offers similar camera quality or in some conditions even better. The dynamic range, saturation, portrait shots all are excellenet in day light. Its nightography function is also extremely good. Talking about video capabilities it offers 8k at 30fps and all other similar in market, its VDIS and OIS feature does make your video rich, steady with prefect light balance. Just like its predecssor this also offers superzoom 100x But all i can add is till 30x its perfectly good after that samsung needs to work on it. Perhaps in next 4-5 years we might be able to have 100x as clear as 30x zoom feature.S Pen:- latency has been reduced to 2.8s which is the super best i can say and also the air gestures is quite fun to use and you can do quite alot with your spen like signing your pdf document on your phone itself without worrying about to get a copy and then signing it. Using S pen also gets the premium vibe to you in day to day uses it feels bossy.Battery life:- its Good can be better on day to day heavy uses it gets 7-8 hours of screen on time which i feel is already good but its competitor 13 pro max has much better battery compare to it. That generally offers 10 -11 hours of uses which is insane. I would ask samsung to focus on its battery this will generally lead to out perform even apple.Everything else is the best no competition design, performance, One UI, camera, S pen and display.

In my opinion,it is a thing of beauty.The speakers are pretty loud with good quality.The call quality can be excellent.The version that I have has the exynos 2022 processor. It is fast and has handled everything that I have thrown at it with no problems or slowdown. It's a powerful multitasking beast. Apps like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter run smoothly on the device. I also have an s22 backup phone that is equipped with an Snapdragon processor; I have not noticed any difference in performance between them.The battery life of the phone has steadily improved as it has learned my routines. Initially I was getting less than a day of use from the battery before having to recharge. Now it is lasting two days before having to recharge.I don't use the S-pen so I can't say much about it.The camera is pretty great. It takes great quality photographs.The fingerprint reader works flawlessly. I had no issues with it.Weaknesses:The phone is heavy.

Love the S22 Ultra,"I have a Samsung Z fold 3 and that has just been a nightmare phone! It's had to go back to Samsung twice now for repairs. The hinge went, the screen broke and the screen protector cracked and lifted. I've only had that phone since September last year. I was at the stage where i was terrified to keep using it. Also the battery life was horrendous!! I have had all 3 fold phones and none of them were great! You think i would have learnt my lesson...As a result i decided to buy the S22 Ultra in burgundy. The phone itself is great. Decent weight, decent screen, and the usual Samsung bloat wear! Having used the phone for 2 days the battery life seems very good, unlike the fold phones!Overall I'm depressed I've had to spend another serious load of cash on another phone, but equally i do really love the handset.Also i have been able to claim the galaxy pro buds via this purchase. For those who have struggled with this claim the Samsung terms state that the phone much be sold/dispatched by Amazon and not a 3rd party seller.

The screen is excellent and the extra size compared to the S10e is actually quite welcome.The only weakness is the fingerprint reader, which is unreliable at best. Most of the time I have to touch and hold the screen for a couple of seconds to then get told my fingerprint is not recognised. Also be careful with 9H glass screen protectors, have tried 2 different brands and neither worked, why couldn't Samsung stick with a physical reader.Overall I am very pleased with the phone, I went for the 256gb model as there is no SD Card slot, but you can put two SIM cards in it.
