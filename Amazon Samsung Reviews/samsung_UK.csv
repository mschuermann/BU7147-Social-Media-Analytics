"DO NOT PURCHASE FROM AMAZON","Purchased phone from amazon as they advertised it as being part of the Samsung promotion for free buds.Submitted claim within 24 hours of delivery of phone, complete with Amazon invoice.Samsung are refusing to honour the free buds offer because the purchase cannot be ""verified"" despite providing clear documentation and proof of purchase.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2022",1

"Pure power","I have had this phone for a few weeks now. In my opinion it is a great phone.Benefits:The display is huge and bright. The best that I have seen on a phone.The phone feels like it is made of the highest quality material. It feels premium. In my opinion,it is a thing of beauty.The speakers are pretty loud with good quality.The call quality can be excellent.The version that I have has the exynos 2022 processor. It is fast and has handled everything that I have thrown at it with no problems or slowdown. It's a powerful multitasking beast. Apps like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter run smoothly on the device. I also have an s22 backup phone that is equipped with an Snapdragon processor; I have not noticed any difference in performance between them.The battery life of the phone has steadily improved as it has learned my routines. Initially I was getting less than a day of use from the battery before having to recharge. Now it is lasting two days before having to recharge.I don't use the S-pen so I can't say much about it.The camera is pretty great. It takes great quality photographs.The fingerprint reader works flawlessly. I had no issues with it.Weaknesses:The phone is heavy. It took me a few days to get use to its weight.The camera array picks up dust easily and it looks like it wouldn't take too much punishment, a lens protector is a must.The phone is not a massive improvement over the s22 ultra.Conclusion:I would highly recommend this phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 March 2022",1
"Love the S22 Ultra","I have a Samsung Z fold 3 and that has just been a nightmare phone! It's had to go back to Samsung twice now for repairs. The hinge went, the screen broke and the screen protector cracked and lifted. I've only had that phone since September last year. I was at the stage where i was terrified to keep using it. Also the battery life was horrendous!! I have had all 3 fold phones and none of them were great! You think i would have learnt my lesson...As a result i decided to buy the S22 Ultra in burgundy. The phone itself is great. Decent weight, decent screen, and the usual Samsung bloat wear! Having used the phone for 2 days the battery life seems very good, unlike the fold phones!Overall I'm depressed I've had to spend another serious load of cash on another phone, but equally i do really love the handset.Also i have been able to claim the galaxy pro buds via this purchase. For those who have struggled with this claim the Samsung terms state that the phone much be sold/dispatched by Amazon and not a 3rd party seller. My phone was sold and despatched by Amazon so the claim went through in less than 24hrs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 March 2022",1
"[Not recommended] Disappointing, slow upgrade from Note 10+ with too many software issues","PRODUCT: 2022 Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra (dual SIM, 512GB)USE CASE: replace 2019 Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ (dual SIM, 256GB)Who am I? A die hard Android user since 2012 (also had Samsung Bada in 2011) whose last truly exciting phone was the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (removable battery, flat screen)VERTICTDo not buy this phone unless price drops to say 800GBP because there are way too many software issues that may or may not be fixed by Samsung in the next 12 months.PROs+ Good screen+ Good speakers+ Good build quality+ 5G+ Useful pen when you need it around 1/month or want to impress strangers+ Depressing: fewer software issues than 2022 Google Pixel 6 series+ Makes the Apple iPhone Pro Max (1350GBP, 5122GB) more attractiveCONs- Actually worse than my Note 10+- Lots of software issues, stuttering, lag, bugs and crashes on a new 1200GBP phone: alpha stage software not optimised. Slow switching between apps. Jittery scrolling- Updates make your phone slower and cause issues with Play Store: unable to update or even install apps. 5-10h time consuming phone reset needed after every major Android/Samsung update that breaks something- No larger size available: I want 7""+ without folding it- Still not a flat screen- Camera: nowhere near as good in video as iPhone Pro- Battery: average at best and 22% worse than iPhone Pro Max and only 8% better than 2019 Note 10+- Fingerprint sensor: still unreliable, albeit a bit faster- Poor value","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 March 2022",1
"Warning S22 Samsung mobile","They are offering Disney plus free for 12 months as a promotion but after several attempts of trying to get this promotion it just keeps coming up with ""this promotion isn't available"" I've got my S22 today I followed all the steps but will not work, other people on the forums are having problems too, so be aware, it has left a very bitter taste in my mouth because it was one of the reasons that I got a new Samsung S22. Instead of enjoying my new phone and watching Disney plus I'm left frustrated and angry at Samsung.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 March 2022",1
"S22 5G Good upgrade from S10e","Bought direct from Samsung as Amazon were out of stock, first impressions were that the phone was a lot bigger than my S10e but having used it for a week it's not a problem.Great phone, fast processore, good battery life, am on day 3 since last charge, still has 27% after reasonable usage. The screen is excellent and the extra size compared to the S10e is actually quite welcome.The only weakness is the fingerprint reader, which is unreliable at best. Most of the time I have to touch and hold the screen for a couple of seconds to then get told my fingerprint is not recognised. Also be careful with 9H glass screen protectors, have tried 2 different brands and neither worked, why couldn't Samsung stick with a physical reader.Overall I am very pleased with the phone, I went for the 256gb model as there is no SD Card slot, but you can put two SIM cards in it. I took advantage of the trade in program and got £300 off the price with an additional discount.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 April 2022",1
"Great phone, better camera.","Only had it a week but by far the best phone I have owned","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 April 2022",1
"Good phone","Good - not great. This is coming from someone who previously had the S9. As a long time Galaxy user the S9 is arguably the best phone in the Galaxy run. It was hard to part from it, when all that was wrong was its cracked screen. But I did, and opted for the S22 this year. From inspection of other friends S21 it's not that different. However its perhaps cosmetically smoother and rounder in shape. In terms of what you can do with it - i've yet to explore or notice anything substantially appealing. I bought this because I love taking photos and so this or the S20 were on my list. This won out because its newer and not much in the way of price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 April 2022",1
"Not much difference between the s21 ultra","This has to be the worst device ive ever owned. Sent it back for the following reasons1. Slow and unresponsive all the time2. Crappy battery life3. Freezing apps and slow animationsI have been on to samsung support about these issues and basically told to wait for software updates.im not prepared to wait months on end hoping for each update to fix the issuessent this back and went for the Oppo Find X5 Pro","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 March 2022",1
